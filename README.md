**Bloobs** is an  easy shooting game.

The goal is to clear the screen of bloobs.
To remove bloobs you have to put together at least three bloobs
of the same color.
Player can see the next bloob that will be loaded into the cannon.
Use keyboard arrows or mouse to move the cannon and shoot.

**Requirements**

This game was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 running Python 2.7 with pyglet installed.

Most games should work for Linux-type systems. Where needed (e.g. hangman.py), I tried to make the code cross-platform compatible.

For Python 3 compatibility, you'll need to run the 2to3 tool, change division (/) to integer division (//), and convert return values of filter(..), map(..), etc. calls to lists.
