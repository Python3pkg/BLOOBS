**Bloobs** is an easy shooting game.

The goal is to clear the screen of bloobs.
To remove bloobs you have to put together at least three bloobs
of the same color.
Player can see the next bloob that will be loaded into the cannon.
Use keyboard arrows or mouse to move the cannon and shoot.

I used to play this game years ago on my sister's computer. 
Since then I've been sorry that this game is available only for Windows and I cannot play it anymore.
When I learned lately how to write Python game using Pyglet (thanks to Pyladies!) I decided to write Bloobs for Linux.
So here it is :)

**Requirements**

This game was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 (also Ubuntu 14) running Python 2.7 with pyglet installed.
